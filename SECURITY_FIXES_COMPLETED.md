## 📊 Security Status Summary

### ✅ FIXED (11/11 Critical Issues):
1. **Webhook Signature Verification** - SECURED
2. **Race Condition Prevention** - SECURED  
3. **Input Sanitization** - ENHANCED
4. **Database Function Security** - SECURED
5. **Database Security Hardening** - COMPLETED
6. **Edge Function Security** - ENHANCED
7. **Profile Validation Enhancement** - COMPLETED
8. **Privilege Escalation Fix** - COMPLETED ⭐ NEW
9. **Database Security Triggers** - COMPLETED ⭐ NEW
10. **Real-time Security Monitoring** - COMPLETED ⭐ NEW
11. **Enhanced Edge Function Security** - COMPLETED ⭐ NEW

### ⚠️ Manual Configuration Required:

**Database Linter Warnings (3 remaining):**
1. **OTP Expiry**: Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Settings (set to 5 minutes)
2. **Password Leak Protection**: Enable in Auth → Settings → Password Protection  
3. **Extension Schema**: Some extensions may still need manual migration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to configure the Stripe webhook secret for full security:

1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Find your webhook endpoint and copy the signing secret
3. Add it as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your Supabase project secrets

Without this secret, webhook signature verification will fail and deposits won't process.

## 🛡️ Security Monitoring

Use the new SecurityMonitor component or `/functions/v1/enhanced-security-monitor` endpoint to check security status:
- Authentication security settings
- Recent user activity monitoring  
- Security recommendations
- Real-time threat detection

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Configure OTP expiry in Supabase Dashboard
2. Enable password leak protection
3. Set up monitoring alerts using the SecurityMonitor component
4. Regular security audits using the linter
5. Monitor security dashboard for ongoing threats
