            LSSICE applies to any type of file or device downloaded to a user's terminal equipment for the purpose of storing data that can be updated and retrieved by the entity responsible for its installation. A cookie is one such widely used file, which we will generically refer to as cookies.

            Cookies are small text files sent to a browser by a web server to record a user's activity on a website, enabling the retrieval of that information later while browsing different pages connected to the server that installed them.
